# Assets
This command is used to generate our asset file as a constant.
```bash
gits assets
```
Here are the steps for creating a logo.png image file as an example:Â 
1. Add the logo files to the `assets/assets/images/` folder
   
   ![File generated](../../static/img/generate/assets/copy_file.png)

2. Generate constants with the command:
    ```bash
    gits assets
    ```
    The logo constant will be generated in the `core/assets/lib/gits_images.dart` file

    ![File generated](../../static/img/generate/assets/const_generated.png)

Adjust the placement of the assets that we use

- Image file path `assets/assets/images/` constant will be generated in the file `core/assets/lib/gits_images.dart`
- The file path icon `assets/assets/icons/` constant will be generated in the file `core/assets/lib/gits_icons.dart`
- The path of the json file `assets/assets/json/` constant will be generated in the file `core/assets/lib/gits_json.dart`
